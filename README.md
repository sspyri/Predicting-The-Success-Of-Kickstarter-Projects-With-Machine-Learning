# Predicting The Success Of Kickstarter Projects With Machine Learning
## Written in Python

**Goal**: <br>*Will a kickstarter project will be successful or not.<br>
           *Trying to get the most accurate results.*<br>
           Expanded goal, was to find which classification model would be the most accurate and best for our problem.*

**Datasets**:<br> *Webrobots Dataset 26.762K projects, 10 features.<br>
               18k Dataset 18.042k projects, 19 features.<br>
               Kicktraq Dataset 6.800k project, 15 features.*
      
**Stages**:<br> *Data cleaning - Data preperation*<br>
            *Feature Selection*<br>
            *Hyperparameter Tuning*<br>
            *Recording of the results with 10 fold cross validation.*

**Conclusion**:<br> *It was found that Random Forest was the best model in this particular problem.*<br>
            *acc 78.29% f1-score 82.10%, in webrobots dataset.*<br>
            *acc 84.08% και f1-score 84.19%, in 18k dataset.*<br>
           *acc 90.39% και f1-score 91.5%, in kicktraq dataset.*
